# SuperPuperMega Brodilka Game

## About
This is a simple RPG-style game with a top-down projection view.
It was created by a group of four BMSTU students as a graduation project for Mail.ru's TechnoPark C++ course.

## Running the game
So far, the easiest way to install and run this game at this point is by using docker and running the `docker.sh` script like this:
```bash
$ ./scipts/docker.sh
```

Alternatively, if you want to build and execute the game natively, you should use the `build-first.sh` script like this:
```bash
$ ./scripts/build-first.sh
```

In this case make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
  - cmake v3.12 or higher;
  - g++ v9.2.0 or higher;
  - conan v1.21.0 or higher.
